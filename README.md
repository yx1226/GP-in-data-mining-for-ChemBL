# Genetic Programming (GP) in data mining for ChemBL

As part of my dissertation, I've referred the papers 
*Calculation of Substructural Analysis Weights Using a Genetic Algorithm (2015)* and 
*Ligand-based virtual screening using a genetic algorithm with data fusion (2018)*
and this repository is my implementation. In this approach, I use 3 types of GP method, which are 
Symbolic Regressor, Cartesian GP and Linear GP, to find out the best result in GP and then compared 
with the result of GA in the papers

## Objective
<li>Random generate an universal equation for all of various ChemBL drug with top 1% dataset.</li>
<li>Compare the GP result with Genetic algorithm (GA) result</li>

## Understanding GP
I did discovery on GP by studying [gplearn Documentation](https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro.html)
and [A Field Guide to Genetic Programming](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Langdon/ftp/papers/poli08_fieldguide.pdf).
